# AutoCat
About: I want a cat door that lets her out in the morning and becomes one-way by evening. Done.
Hardware: Arduino microcontroller, servo, 3x seven segment displays, 2x input potentiometers, 2x tactile switches in an enclosure. Custom cat door, too. The servo rotates a one-way lock into place.
